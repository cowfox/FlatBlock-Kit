# FlatBlock Wireframe Kit

This `Wireframe Kit` is initially inspired by the [this website](http://codyhouse.co/) which provides a "color block" based mockup. For example:

This toolkit aims to help facilitate the building process of this kind of mockup. 

## Wireframe Kit Contents

The  current toolkit includes the following components: 

- Flat UI Color Palette
- OmniGraffle Stencil
- OmniGraffle Example

### Flat UI Color Palette

The Flat colors collected are from the project [Bootflat](https://github.com/bootflat/bootflat.github.io).

It has the following formats:

- Srouce file (`.cs`) from the **Mac App** [ColorSchemer Studio 2](http://www.colorschemer.com/index.php). 
- Export version (`.clr`), used by the Mac system. Once it is imported, it can also be used inside OmniGraffle. 

> From the `source file`, it can be also easily exported into other formats like `ASE`, `AI`, `CSS`, `PNG`, etc. 

### OmniGraffle Stencil

The `stencil` includes the basic elements that are usually used in this "block mockup" process. 

- Basic Frames for **web** and **mobile**. 
- Buttons
- Content Blocks
- Layout Components

It also include all **color** pickups just in case. 


### OmniGraffle Examples

Inside the `stencil` file, it also includes several examples which are built right upon this **stencil**. 

Here is the example **copied** from [codyhouse.co](http://codyhouse.co/)/

Here is another example for **mobile only**.

## Contribute!

Feel free to contribute if you are liking this style of mockup. 

I will continue to expand the `stencil`, by adding more **icons / colors** as well as **usefaul wedgets**. 

Always welcome to accept any feedback!
